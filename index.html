                <h2>Fashion + Beauty</h2>
                <p> 
                    I love Rihanna! She's beautiful and makes a statement with her fashion sense. She has a beauty line called Fenty Beauty which has been super successful. Rihanna wanted to create makeup for all women of color. She has several different shades and products for all skin tones. She has recently became Barbados' first billionaire ever. She also has a lingerie line that is made for women of differnt sizes.

                <h2>The Music that Made Her</h2>
                <p>
                    Rihanna has released many number one hits: SOS, What's My Name, and We Found Love. She has 14 to be exact!  
                </p>

                    It was the music she made that really made me love her. I remember being in middle school when I first heard her songs. My friends and I would always jam out to her on the radio. Although, I couldn't relate in all cases, the beat of the music and the Caribbean feel just captured me. There were times I'd be jamming out to a song about a broken heart and feeling like I really was hurt.
